There is a new version of this demo with newer Angular versions here:

## Troubleshooting

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you want to run with the latest NodeJS I might be set this environment variable:

  set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

_**NOTE:** You can specify environment variables in WebStorm run configuration._
